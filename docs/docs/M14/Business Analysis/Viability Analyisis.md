## Feasibility Analysis of Artificial Intelligence Solutions for Computer Vision at Atvos

This feasibility analysis compares market solutions for implementing a computer vision system aimed at identifying Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and detecting fires at Atvos. The analysis considers solutions from Minsait and UniversoMOBI (with its Mob Conduta product), in contrast to the solution developed in-house by the SIMPATIA Project.

### Analyzed Solutions

* **Minsait:** A global technology and digital transformation consultancy, part of the Indra group. Minsait offers a broad portfolio of artificial intelligence and computer vision solutions, with the capability to develop customized, large-scale projects for the industry. The implementation of its solutions, while robust and comprehensive, tends to have a higher initial cost and an implementation time that can vary depending on the complexity of the scope.

* **UniversoMOBI (Mob Conduta):** Mob Conduta is a more specific and ready-to-use market solution. Using smart cameras and computer vision, the system monitors employee behavior in real-time, focusing on workplace safety. Its main feature is verifying the correct use of PPE through facial recognition and video analysis, as well as identifying risky behaviors. The platform generates alerts for supervisors and managers, and also collects and analyzes data to identify trends and critical areas. No information was found regarding fire detection as a native feature of the product.

* **SIMPATIA Project:** This is an in-house developed solution, which, on one hand, results in a lower initial implementation cost. On the other hand, the solution is described as less complete and more complex to implement compared to market solutions.

### Comparative Feasibility Analysis

| Criteria | Minsait | UniversoMOBI (Mob Conduta) | SIMPATIA Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Solution Scope** | Broad and customizable. Potential to include both PPE identification and fire detection, as well as other security and process optimization features. | Focused on workplace safety, with an emphasis on identifying PPE use and risky behaviors. Fire detection is not an advertised feature. | Limited to the functionalities developed in-house. Less complete than market solutions. |
| **Ease of Implementation** | Varies with project complexity. As a custom solution, implementation can be longer and require greater involvement from the Atvos team. | High. As an off-the-shelf solution, implementation tends to be faster and with less need for customization. | Low. The implementation is described as more complex, which may require more time and internal resources to ensure the solution's stability and effectiveness. |
| **Initial Implementation Cost**| High. The cost of a custom solution from a global consultancy like Minsait tends to be the highest among the options. | Medium. The licensing cost of a ready-to-use solution is typically lower than a custom project but still represents a significant investment. | Low. The main cost is in development and the allocation of internal resources, making it the option with the lowest initial outlay. |
| **Support and Maintenance**| Continuous and specialized. Minsait offers support and maintenance contracts to ensure the solution's operation and evolution. | Continuous. UniversoMOBI offers support for its platform, ensuring Mob Conduta is updated and functioning correctly. | Dependent on the internal team. The maintenance and evolution of the solution are the responsibility of the SIMPATIA Project team, which could pose challenges in case of high demand or the need for new features. |

### Conclusion

The choice of the solution to be implemented at Atvos will focus on the market options, Minsait and Mob Conduta, since the SIMPATIA Project solution will not be used at this initial stage. Despite its low cost, the higher implementation complexity and more limited scope of the in-house project make it less viable for immediate adoption compared to the established alternatives.

The analysis for the final decision therefore falls on the two market proposals:

* **Minsait** presents itself as the most robust and complete option, capable of custom-fitting all of Atvos's present and future needs, including both PPE identification and fire detection. However, its high cost and implementation time are factors that require a more in-depth budget and schedule analysis.

* **UniversoMOBI's Mob Conduta** is an excellent alternative for a rapid implementation focused on workplace safety, especially for monitoring PPE use. Atvos would benefit from a platform that is already tested and has proven results. The absence of a fire detection feature, however, is a point to consider and may require a complementary solution.
