## Public Report – SIMPATIA Project Module 14

The **SIMPATIA** project (System for Identification and Monitoring for Assured Protection of Workers using AI) was developed with the objective of automating the identification and monitoring of workers wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in industrial plants. Using computer vision techniques and real-time image processing, the system aims to increase safety and efficiency in Atvos' operations by reducing manual effort and improving the consistency of compliance monitoring.

For the development of the five sprints of this module, I focused on different stages of research, implementation, and technical validation of the solution. The first sprint was entirely dedicated to defining the roadmap of partial deliveries and organizing the planning for the remainder of the project. This involved aligning expectations, documenting sprint deliverables, and distributing the focus between business strategy and technical development across the following iterations.

During the second sprint, the focus shifted to strategic foundations. A PESTEL analysis was conducted to evaluate the external factors impacting the project, identifying risks such as algorithmic bias and privacy regulations like LGPD, as well as opportunities tied to increasing safety requirements in industrial environments. A Five Forces (Porter) analysis helped identify SIMPATIA’s position in the competitive landscape, showing a strategic niche with limited rivals and low buyer power due to the high compliance pressure in the industry. In addition, a financial feasibility model was created, proposing a B2B SaaS model with a per-camera pricing structure that enables a positive ROI for small and medium-sized plants within the first year. Two key internal documents were produced during this sprint: a model training guide with retraining protocols and performance tracking, and a user onboarding manual to assist field teams in operating the system and managing alerts.

In the third sprint, development efforts returned to the technical domain. The main goals were refining the dataset and improving the model’s performance. New images were captured from the operational environment to ensure variety in lighting, perspective, and PPE usage. A data augmentation pipeline was implemented with transformations such as rotation, blur, brightness/contrast adjustment, and horizontal flips, resulting in a threefold increase in dataset diversity. A benchmark study comparing YOLOv8 (used in earlier iterations) and YOLOv12 was conducted, analyzing accuracy, latency, and computational demands. Despite limited time due to high-priority tasks in another internal project at Atvos, this sprint laid the groundwork for the transition to a more robust AI model.

The fourth sprint marked the consolidation of the AI component through the complete implementation of a YOLOv12-based training pipeline. A dataset from Roboflow was formatted and integrated using custom YAML files, with adjusted parameters such as image resolution, number of epochs, and checkpointing. The model achieved reliable results across key PPE classes including helmets, gloves, and vests. During training, segmentation and bounding box mismatches caused errors, which were resolved through YAML file correction and fallback mechanisms. The training notebook was translated into English to enhance its accessibility for international teams and future documentation needs. This sprint established the technical reliability of the solution and its readiness for integration into an operational pipeline.

In the final sprint, Sprint 5, the system reached its most functional version. The YOLOv12 model achieved a **mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5)** of **61.4%**, validating its detection capabilities. The detection pipeline was integrated with a Python system supporting multi-threaded processing, enabling each camera to be handled independently, thus ensuring scalability. Upon detecting a violation, such as the absence of a helmet, the system captures the frame, names the file with a timestamp (`capture_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`), and triggers a **desktop notification** via the `win11toast` library. Users can click on the alert to instantly view the captured image. These images are automatically stored in a **OneDrive** folder synchronized with **SharePoint**, making them accessible to a **Power BI dashboard**. The dashboard reads metadata from image filenames, allowing users to filter events by date and time, visualize detection trends, and review each flagged frame in context.

Additionally, a feasibility analysis was carried out comparing SIMPATIA to two commercial alternatives (Minsait and Mob Conduta). While SIMPATIA demonstrated a lower implementation cost and full ownership of the pipeline, its higher complexity and limited scope at this stage led to the strategic decision to prioritize a market-ready solution. Future steps will include evaluating the cost-benefit of Minsait’s customizable platform versus the quicker deployment capabilities of Mob Conduta.

Throughout these five sprints, the SIMPATIA project evolved from a theoretical concept into a working MVP capable of real-time PPE detection, automated alerting, and structured reporting. The system integrates seamlessly with enterprise tools like OneDrive and Power BI, while maintaining the flexibility of local computer vision processing with open-source tools. It represents a scalable, low-cost approach to improving workplace safety and has the potential to be expanded across different production units at Atvos.

Future improvements include refining the model to support additional PPE classes, such as safety boots and goggles, and deeper integration with the HikVision camera system to transition from simulation to real-world deployment. With a strong technical and strategic foundation, the SIMPATIA project stands ready for the next phase of industrial innovation.
