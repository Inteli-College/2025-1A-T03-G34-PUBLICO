# Overview

This is the report for Sprint 2 of Module 14 (M14-S2), covering the analytical deliverables produced for the SIMPATIA Project. The sprint focused on building strategic and financial frameworks to support the business and technical direction of the system, as well as producing key documentation for initial model usage and user onboarding.

## Changes from Previous Sprint

### Shift from Technical Dev to Strategic Analysis

In the previous sprint, efforts were mainly centered around system design and initial RTSP camera integration. In this sprint, the focus strategically shifted toward **business validation** and **operational readiness** of the project. This pivot was essential to align the technical development with a robust foundation of strategic planning and feasibility.

## Key Deliverables

### PESTEL Analysis

A complete **PESTEL analysis** was developed to assess the macro-environmental factors impacting the deployment of SIMPATIA. Key highlights included:

- **Political:** Opportunity with increasing safety regulations.
- **Technological:** Risk of algorithmic bias and fast-paced AI evolution.
- **Legal:** Concern over privacy laws (e.g. LGPD) and regulatory changes.

This analysis helped to **identify critical risks and opportunities**, guiding future mitigation strategies and compliance planning.

### Five Forces (Porter)

The **Five Forces framework** was elaborated to analyze SIMPATIAâ€™s competitive positioning:

- **Threat of Substitutes:** Medium, due to traditional methods.
- **Rivalry:** Moderate, with limited local competitors like Dfensys.
- **Buyer Power:** Low in high-risk industries with compliance pressures.

This helped justify the **strategic niche** SIMPATIA is entering, validating the product-market fit and giving strength to positioning statements for future pitching or investment.

### Financial Analysis

A preliminary **financial projection** was built to simulate expected revenue and cost structures based on a B2B SaaS model with per-camera pricing. Main insights:

- Viable ROI within the first year for small to mid-sized plants.
- Scalability through modular pricing and recurring revenue.

This model supports internal decision-making, and also prepares ground for **future funding presentations** or internal budget justifications.

### Model Training & Usage Docs

Two internal-facing documents were developed and are being maintained as part of the project's technical wiki:

- **Model Training Guide**: Includes the structure of training datasets, performance metrics, and retraining protocol.
- **Initial User Guide**: Provides onboarding steps for field safety managers and IT staff on how to use the SIMPATIA interface, receive alerts, and report false positives.

These deliverables are key to **enable reproducibility, onboarding, and operational scaling** of the system.

## Challenges and Delays

### Time Constraints and Scope Balancing

Balancing between strategic analysis and ongoing backend/model improvements was challenging. Though development tasks were light in this sprint, the depth required for high-quality documentation and financial modeling demanded **significant solo research and iteration cycles**.

## Next Steps

For Sprint 3 (M14-S3), the focus will return to technical advancement with:

- Improvements in modeling and retraining.
- Incorporation of the strategic insights from this sprint into pitch decks and stakeholder presentations.
- Collect new images from operation cameras.
- Initiation of data augmentation tecniches to industrial enviroment application.

## Summary

- **PESTEL**: Completed with risk factors like algorithmic bias and legal uncertainty added.
- **5 Porter Forces**: Delivered to position SIMPATIA within its competitive environment.
- **Financial Analysis**: Initial unit economics and ROI model created.
- **Documentation**: Training protocol and user guide drafted and versioned.
- **Strategic Shift**: Focus changed from technical dev to market and ops validation.

Despite fewer code commits this sprint, the **strategic groundwork laid here is vital** to ensuring that SIMPATIA evolves into a sustainable, scalable, and aligned solution.
