# Overview

This is the report for Sprint 3 of Module 13 (M13-S3), covering the progress made, challenges encountered, and the adjustments made throughout the sprint. In this period, I focused on the research and development of the HikVision API integration and the automation of report acquisition for the company.

## Changes from Previous Sprint

### Model Development Adjustment

In the previous sprint, the focus was on retraining the model with the new dataset for "helmet and head" detection. However, this task was moved to the backlog of another sprint to allow for the prioritization of other tasks in this sprint. The decision was made to shift the attention to integrating the HikVision API with the project.

### HikVision API Integration

A major effort in this sprint was dedicated to the research and development of the integration of the HikVision API with our project. This API will allow us to enhance the system’s capabilities, particularly in monitoring and managing surveillance camera data. Although this integration work began in this sprint, there were some delays due to other responsibilities, and I plan to continue this work in the next sprint as well.

## Challenges and Delays

### TI Support and Automation Development

During this sprint, I was also involved in handling IT support tickets, which caused some delays in the initial stages of the HikVision API research and development. This shift in focus led to some time constraints but did not stop the progress entirely.

Additionally, I started the development of an automation system for acquiring reports for the company. This task is crucial for streamlining our internal processes, but it also required a portion of the time that was initially allocated to the API integration. 

## Next Steps

The main focus in the upcoming sprint will continue to be on finalizing the HikVision API integration, as it is a crucial feature for the project’s success. I will also talk with organization about the traveling to Atvos plants, and probably will change the scheduling of these first tests implementations to another Sprint.

## Summary

- **Model Development**: The "helmet and head" dataset retraining was moved to the backlog for future sprints.
- **HikVision API Integration**: Research and development were started but will continue in the next sprint due to delays.
- **IT Support and Automation**: Involvement in IT support and automation development for report acquisition caused slight delays in the API integration work.

This sprint was a productive yet challenging phase, with significant progress in multiple areas, despite the adjustments required along the way.
